***Important***

Is is unlikely any issues will arise by flashing your MegaRAID controller, but always use caution.
Make sure that you have a backup of your data on the Virtual drives that are connected to your MegaRAID controller that you are flashing.

To flash MegaRAID RAID controllers, you can use LSA, (LSI StorageAuthority) or storcli.
Make sure that you get the latest storcli for your product.
Using an old version of storcli may result in flash failure.

storcli /cx download file=filename 

Note - /cx is a variable, usually /c0 and can be confirmed with storcli show

It is highly recommended to also update the PSoC firmware as well:
storcli /cx download file=pblp_catalog.signed.rom


You may also save your configuration (Highly recommended) with storcli:
Save config:
storcli64 /c0 get config file=c0.cfg

Store the file off the server.
If changes are made to the Virtual drive configuration such as a spare rebuilding, the file needs to be updated.
